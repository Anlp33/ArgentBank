# Argent Bank

The project is about a new start-up bank, Argent Bank, which is trying to break into the industry and needs help setting up its app

Phase 1: User Authentication - Creation of a web application allowing customers to log in and manage their accounts and profile.
Phase 2: Transactions - This would be to specify the API endpoints needed for a possible second mission once we have completed the first.

## Technologies
- JS
- React
- Redux
- CSS 

## Prerequisites

- NodeJS (version 12.18)
- Npm
- MongoDB Community Server (back-end)
 
## Installing Back-End

1. Clone the repository:
`https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/Project-10-Bank-API.git`
2. Open a terminal window in the cloned project
3. Run the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local dev server
npm run dev:server

# Populate database with two users
npm run populate-db
```

Your server should now be running at http://locahost:3001 and you will now have two users in your MongoDB database!

## Populated Database Data

Once you run the `populate-db` script, you should have two users in your database (Tony Stark and Steve Rogers).

## Installing Front-End

Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/Anlp33/Anne-laure-POIRE_13_09052022.git`

Inside the front-end repository, install dependencies:

`npm install`

Launch the app:

`npm start`
